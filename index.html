                            Work and Study is a program that gives students an official work permit while they continue to
                            study the language, which
                            has different conditions in different countries but all have a common name. The Work and Study
                            program provides students
                            with the opportunity to develop their language skills in a wider area while providing economic
                            support.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under Work and Study, students enroll in a language school that suits their needs, goals and
                            budget and attend the
                            school's classes. Students are also granted a work permit, the duration of which varies
                            according to the individual
                            circumstances of each country. While part-time work permits are usually considered, full-time
                            work may also be possible
                            in some countries. In this way, students can earn enough money to cover their daily living
                            expenses while continuing
                            their language studies. The work experience is much more valuable than the money earned, as it
                            is the experience of
                            working in a different culture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The content of the Work and Study program varies from country to country. Considering the
                            advantages of the program, we
                            can see that it has a different position than other short or long-term language education
                            programs. However, there is an
                            important point to be considered: Since the rules and scope of the Work and Study program in
                            each country are different,
                            students should get detailed information about each of them in order to choose the most suitable
                            program for them and
                            make their decision accordingly.

                            There are certain criteria that must be met in order to participate in the Work and Study
                            program. We can examine what
                            needs to be done and provided under certain headings;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Enrolling in an education program: The Work and Study program is designed for students. For this
                            reason, the first
                            condition to be included in the program is that you are a student. The program allows students
                            to work while continuing
                            their education. If you are not an active student in an education program, you cannot
                            participate in the program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Age limit:</span> To apply for the Work and Study program, you must be of legal age, i.e. over 18 years
                            old. There is no upper
                            age limit specified in the programs, but this may vary according to the visa procedures of the
                            countries, so please
                            check.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Language proficiency:</span> In fact, there is no minimum language proficiency specified for
                            participation in the program.
                            However, when we look at it broadly, you should have enough language proficiency to be able to
                            communicate with the
                            people you will encounter in your working life and your colleagues. We always recommend this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Financial situation:</span> The Work and Study program is designed to meet the financial needs of the
                            students, providing them
                            with the means to do so, providing an environment in which they can officially work without any
                            problems. However, the
                            program and the visa application require a certain level of financial resources. If this
                            condition is not met, the
                            related costs cannot be paid, the visa cannot be obtained and the program cannot be implemented.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Visa To Participate:</span> in the Work and Study program, you must have an appropriate visa. The type
                            of visa you need to apply
                            for will vary depending on the program and duration of your study and the country where you will
                            be studying. Sometimes
                            your visa process will be for the full duration of your studies. Sometimes you can extend your
                            program, sometimes you
                            can renew it, and in these cases you can extend your visa.

                            will be evaluated and the

                            required for
                            participation, is when work permits start. Sometimes the start date of your visa is also an
                            indication of your ability
                            to work, sometimes you have to wait for a while or complete the necessary residence procedures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The duration of the program can be chosen depending on students' educational goals, financial
                            situation and other
                            personal factors. It is therefore important for students to choose the country that best suits
                            their needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The work permits offered by countries under the Work and Study program have certain limits. From
                            time to time, the hours
                            of these work permits can be changed as needed; we saw the most recent example of this in
                            Australia towards the end of
                            the pandemic, after opening its doors; due to the need for labor force in the country, student
                            visa holders could work
                            for a maximum of 40 hours in every two-week period, then it was decided to change it back to
                            part-time, but after that,
                            it was updated to 48 hours in two weeks as there was still not enough labor force.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, some countries offer the possibility to extend the training period. In Ireland, for
                            example, you can renew your
                            25-week Work and Study program twice and stay in the country for about two years, continue your
                            language studies and use
                            your work permit.
